# Gretl replicaton files for "Forecasting: Principles and Practice" (3rd edition)

This repository provides replication files for the book "Forecasting: Principles and Practice (3rd edition)" by Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, using the Gretl software. It is intended to help readers reproduce the examples and analyses from the book with Gretl, offering scripts and data files that mirror the R-based workflows presented in the original text. The repository is a resource for students, educators, and practitioners interested in learning forecasting methods with open-source tools.

E-book online available at https://otexts.com/fpp3/. It uses the `fpp3` package for R.

There is also a new Python edition of the book, available at https://otexts.com/fpppy entitled "Forecasting: Principles and Practice, the Pythonic Way" (out since autumn 2025).

**However, the replication files in this repository are based on the R version of the book.**

## Data files
The data files used in the replication scripts are available in the `data/` folder. There are CSV files as well as Gretl data files (`*.gdt`). Both formats can be opened directly in Gretl.
